# colorado-public-data-list

**A curated list of public datasets for Colorado.**

The most thorough sources of Coloradoan open data sources are the Open Colorado data catalog ([data.opencolorado.org](http://data.opencolorado.org)) and the Colorado Information Marketplace ([data.colorado.gov](https://data.colorado.gov)).

However, there are many other sources of public data that may not meet the formal definition of "open data" (namely, machine-readable, API-ready CKAN/Socrata-formats; see the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) guidelines). Alternatively, the data may not be from an official government source (not included in the above portals). 

**This repo documents public Colorado data sources (that may or may not be "open"), as well as promote citizen-led attempts at making public data more open (see "Citizen-Wrangled Data" header).** It is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather serve as a launchpad for data science for social good/civic hacking project ideas.

Note: There's many fantastic federal data sources like [data.gov](http://data.gov), the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov) for spatial data, and [censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org) that contain Colorado data can't be thoroughly listed here (maybe in a future iteration). OpenDataSoft's collection of [open data portals worldwide](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/) is also inspiring.

# Citizen-Wrangled Data


Below are some open-source Github projects that we know of trying to make Colorado data more open.

Feel free to get in touch or submit an Github issue if (1) you have a project wrangling Colorado data, or (2) have a recommendation on what public data to wrangle next / want to work together on something!

## Completed Projects
